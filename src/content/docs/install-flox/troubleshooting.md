If you run into problems installing Flox,
this page will help you diagnose what went wrong and find a solution.

## Finding install logs

The first step in debugging a failed installation is to find the install logs.
The location depends on your operating system.

### macOS

The macOS system installer logs to `/var/log/install.log`.

The install log contains logs from installations of other installed macOS packages, so to get just the lines relevant to Flox, run this script:

```bash
awk '
/com\.floxdev\.flox/ {
  if (first == 0) first = NR
  last = NR
}
{ lines[NR] = $0 }
END {
  if (first && last && first <= last) {
    for (i = first; i <= last; i++) print lines[i]
  }
}' /var/log/install.log
```

### Linux

On Linux the Flox installer writes a log file to `/tmp` with a timestamped
filename:

```text
/tmp/flox-installation.log.<timestamp>
```

For example:

```text
/tmp/flox-installation.log.1773188428
```

List matching files to find it:

```sh
ls -al /tmp/flox-installation.log.*
```

## Previous Nix installation

The most common cause of a failed Flox installation is a previous Nix installation on the system.
Although the Flox installer attempts to install over an existing Nix
installation, it's possible for a prior installation to end up in a non-standard
state that the Flox installer doesn't know how to handle.

### Solution: manually cleanup previous installation state

In some cases, it may be possible to workaround an error in the installation log
for your system (`/var/log/install.log` or `/tmp/flox-installation.log.*`).
This might involved manually removing parts of the pre-existing Nix installation.

### Solution: remove the previous Nix installation

The most surefire way to get back to a clean state is to completely remove the prior installation.
Note that this will completely remove `/nix/store`, so all Nix packages will
have to be re-downloaded or re-built.

#### Flox uninstaller

If you have a partial Flox installation, you can run Flox uninstallation.

**MacOS (Pkg)**

**The following commands will completely remove Nix and the contents of `/nix/*` from the system.**

Be sure to back up the system and/or extract any important Nix-related
files and packages before continuing.

1. Ensure no running processes are using `/nix`.

1. Run:

    ```text
    sudo /usr/local/share/flox/scripts/uninstall
    ```

Regardless of the current state, brew can be used to perform a full clean up:
```text
brew uninstall --force --zap flox
```

We recommend rebooting your system after uninstalling Flox.

**MacOS (Homebrew)**

**The following commands will completely remove Nix and the contents of `/nix/*` from the system.**

Be sure to back up the system and/or extract any important Nix-related
files and packages before continuing.

**You may be asked if the terminal has permission to modify contents of the disk.**

Run:

```text
brew uninstall flox
```

To remove all traces of flox including user preferences uninstall with:

```text
brew uninstall --zap flox
```

In the case of recovering a partial install, a force and zap can help:
```text
brew uninstall --force --zap flox
```

We recommend rebooting your system after uninstalling Flox.

**Debian**

For use on Debian, Ubuntu, and other Debian-based distributions.

**The following command will completely remove Nix and the contents of `/nix/*` from the system.**

Be sure to back up the system and/or extract any important Nix-related
files and packages before continuing.

```text
sudo apt-get purge flox
```

We recommend rebooting your system after uninstalling Flox.

**RPM**

For use on RedHat, CentOS, Amazon Linux, and other RPM-based
distributions.

**The following command will completely remove Nix and the contents of `/nix/*` from the system.**

Be sure to back up the system and/or extract any important Nix-related
files and packages before continuing.

```text
sudo yum remove flox
```

We recommend rebooting your system after uninstalling Flox.

**Output on success:**

```
$ sudo yum remove flox

#### Nix uninstaller

If you have a prior Nix installation but haven't installed Flox, follow the
uninstallation instructions for your existing Nix installation method:

**Determinate Nix Installer**

If Nix was installed with the
[Determinate Nix Installer](https://github.com/DeterminateSystems/nix-installer),
run:

```sh
/nix/nix-installer uninstall
```

Then re-run the Flox installer.

**Other Nix installations**

For Nix installations that were not made with the Determinate Nix Installer,
follow the
[official Nix uninstall instructions](https://nix.dev/manual/nix/stable/installation/uninstall)
for your platform.

Then re-run the Flox installer.

## Common problems

### Orphaned Nix build users macOS

On macOS, a previous Nix installation may have created system users
named `_nixbld1` through `_nixbld32`.
If these users were not fully removed during uninstallation,
the Flox installer's post-install script can fail because it expects to create
these users with specific UIDs.

This is particularly common with Nix installations that are two or more years old
(prior to macOS 15).
See [NixOS/nix#10892](https://github.com/NixOS/nix/issues/10892) for background.

#### Symptoms

The install log (`/var/log/install.log`) contains an error like:

```text
It seems the build user _nixbld8 already exists, but with the UID '308'.
```

#### Solution

Remove the orphaned build users and then re-install Flox.

1. Delete the orphaned build users:

    ```sh
    for i in $(seq 1 32); do sudo dscl . -delete /Users/_nixbld$i 2>/dev/null; done
    ```

2. If the `/nix` APFS volume is still mounted, remove it:

    ```sh
    sudo diskutil apfs deleteVolume /nix
    ```

3. Re-install Flox following the instructions on the [Install](/docs/install-flox/install) page.

### Homebrew uninstall did not fully clean up macOS

If you previously installed Flox via Homebrew and the uninstallation did not
complete cleanly (for example, the `/nix` volume could not be unmounted),
you may need to force a full cleanup before re-installing.

#### Solution

```sh
brew uninstall --force --zap flox
```

After rebooting, re-install Flox following the instructions on the
[Install](/docs/install-flox/install) page.

### Flox builds from source when installed as a Nix flake input

If you consume Flox as a flake input in your NixOS or nix-darwin configuration,
you may find that Nix builds Flox from source instead of fetching it from the
Flox binary cache.
There are two common causes.

#### Using follows for nixpkgs

If your flake input for Flox uses `inputs.nixpkgs.follows = "nixpkgs"`,
the resulting store paths will differ from the ones in the Flox binary cache
because the cache was built against the nixpkgs revision pinned in the
[Flox flake.lock](https://github.com/flox/flox).

##### Solution

Remove the `follows` directive so that Flox uses its own pinned nixpkgs:

```nix
# flake.nix
{
  inputs = {
    flox.url = "github:flox/flox";
    # Do NOT add: flox.inputs.nixpkgs.follows = "nixpkgs";
  };
}
```

The trade-off is an extra copy of nixpkgs in your Nix store,
but Flox's dependencies and yours will coexist without collisions.

#### Flox binary cache not in substituters

Even with the correct Nix configuration files,
the Flox binary cache (`cache.flox.dev`) may appear only in
`trusted-substituters` and not in `substituters`.
Nix only queries caches listed in `substituters` (or `extra-substituters`)
during builds.
The `trusted-substituters` setting only controls which caches
non-root users are *permitted* to add via `extra-substituters` —
it does not cause Nix to query those caches on its own.

##### Diagnosis

```sh
nix config show | grep substituters
```

If `cache.flox.dev` appears in `trusted-substituters` but **not** in
`substituters`, Nix will never query it and will fall back to building
from source.

##### Solution

Add the Flox cache to `extra-substituters` so that it is merged into
`substituters` and actually queried during builds.
For example, in your NixOS or nix-darwin `nix.settings`:

```nix
nix.settings = {
  extra-substituters = [ "https://cache.flox.dev" ];
  extra-trusted-public-keys = [
    "flox-cache-public-1:7F4OyH7ZCnFhcze3fJdfyXYLQw/aV7GEed86nQ7IsOs="
  ];
};
```

Or directly in `/etc/nix/nix.conf`:

```ini
extra-substituters = https://cache.flox.dev
extra-trusted-public-keys = flox-cache-public-1:7F4OyH7ZCnFhcze3fJdfyXYLQw/aV7GEed86nQ7IsOs=
```

Verify the change took effect:

```sh
nix config show | grep substituters
```

`cache.flox.dev` should now appear in the `substituters` line.
