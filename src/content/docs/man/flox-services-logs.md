## NAME

flox-services-logs - show logs of services

## SYNOPSIS

```text
flox [<general-options>] services logs
     [-d=<path> | -r=<owner/name>]
     [--follow]
     [-n=<num>]
     [<name>] ...
```

## DESCRIPTION

Display the logs of the specified services.

If no services are specified, then the `--follow` flag is required and logs
from all services will be printed in real time.

One or more service names specified with the `--follow` flag will follow the
logs for the specified services.

If a service name is supplied without the `--follow` flag then all of the
available logs are displayed for that service. If specified with the `-n` flag
then only the most recent `<num>` lines from that service are displayed.

An error will be returned if a specified service does not exist.

## OPTIONS

**`--follow`**
Follow log output for the specified services. Required when no service
names are supplied.

**`-n`, `--tail`**
Display only the last `<num>` lines from the logs of the specified
services.

**`<name>`**
Which service(s) to display logs for. When omitted logs from all services
will be displayed but the `--follow` flag is required.

### Environment Options

If no environment is specified for an environment command,
the environment in the current directory
or the active environment that was last activated is used.

**`-d`, `--dir`**
Path containing a .flox/ directory.

**`-r`, `--reference`**
A FloxHub environment, specified in the form `<owner>/<name>`.

**`-D`, `--default`**
Use your default environment (`<your-user>/default`).
When unauthenticated in an interactive context, you will be prompted to
log in.
In non-interactive contexts (e.g., scripts or CI), this flag will fail
with an error when authentication is missing.
### General Options

**`-h`, `--help`**
Prints help information.

The following options can be passed when running any `flox` subcommand but must
be specified _before_ the subcommand.

**`-v`, `--verbose`**
Increase logging verbosity.
Invoke multiple times for increasing detail.

**`-q`, `--quiet`**
Silence logs except for errors.

## EXAMPLES

Follow logs for all services:
```console
$ flox services logs --follow
service1: hello
service2: hello
...
```

Follow logs for a subset of services:
```console
$ flox services logs --follow service1 service3
service1: hello
service3: hello
...
```

Display all available logs for a single service:
```console
$ flox services logs myservice
starting...
running...
stopping...
completed
```
