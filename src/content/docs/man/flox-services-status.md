## NAME

flox-services-status - display the status of services

## SYNOPSIS

```text
flox [<general-options>] services status
     [-d=<path> | -r=<owner/name>]
     [--json]
     [<name>] ...
```

## DESCRIPTION

Displays the status of one or more services.

If no services are specified, then all services will be displayed. If no
services have been started for this environment, an error will be displayed.
An error will also be displayed if one of the specified services
does not exist.

## OPTIONS

**`--json`**
Print statuses formatted as JSON. Each service is printed as a single JSON
object on its own line.

### Environment Options

If no environment is specified for an environment command,
the environment in the current directory
or the active environment that was last activated is used.

**`-d`, `--dir`**
Path containing a .flox/ directory.

**`-r`, `--reference`**
A FloxHub environment, specified in the form `<owner>/<name>`.

**`-D`, `--default`**
Use your default environment (`<your-user>/default`).
When unauthenticated in an interactive context, you will be prompted to
log in.
In non-interactive contexts (e.g., scripts or CI), this flag will fail
with an error when authentication is missing.
### General Options

**`-h`, `--help`**
Prints help information.

The following options can be passed when running any `flox` subcommand but must
be specified _before_ the subcommand.

**`-v`, `--verbose`**
Increase logging verbosity.
Invoke multiple times for increasing detail.

**`-q`, `--quiet`**
Silence logs except for errors.

## EXAMPLES

Display statuses for all services:
```console
$ flox services status
NAME       STATUS            PID
sleeping   Running         89718
myservice  Running         12345
```

Display the status of a single service:
```console
$ flox services status myservice
NAME       STATUS            PID
myservice  Running         12345
```
