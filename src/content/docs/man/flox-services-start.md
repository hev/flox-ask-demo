## NAME

flox-services-start - start services

## SYNOPSIS

```text
flox [<general-options>] services start
     [-d=<path> | -r=<owner/name>]
     [<name>] ...
```

## DESCRIPTION

Starts the specified services.

If any services are currently running, a warning will be displayed for each
specified service that is already running, but the command will still succeed.
If a specified service does not exist, an error will be displayed and no services
will be started.

If no services are currently running, then the services will be started from an
ephemeral activation in order to use the most recent build of the environment.
This may be different from the build of the environment that the current shell
has activated, so the services and your shell may have different environment
variables or values. To ensure that your shell and the services have the same
environment, reactivate your environment after making edits to the manifest.

A remote environment can only have a single set of running services, regardless
of how many times the environment is activated concurrently.

## OPTIONS

`<name>`
: The name(s) of the services to start.

### Environment Options

If no environment is specified for an environment command,
the environment in the current directory
or the active environment that was last activated is used.

**`-d`, `--dir`**
Path containing a .flox/ directory.

**`-r`, `--reference`**
A FloxHub environment, specified in the form `<owner>/<name>`.

**`-D`, `--default`**
Use your default environment (`<your-user>/default`).
When unauthenticated in an interactive context, you will be prompted to
log in.
In non-interactive contexts (e.g., scripts or CI), this flag will fail
with an error when authentication is missing.
### General Options

**`-h`, `--help`**
Prints help information.

The following options can be passed when running any `flox` subcommand but must
be specified _before_ the subcommand.

**`-v`, `--verbose`**
Increase logging verbosity.
Invoke multiple times for increasing detail.

**`-q`, `--quiet`**
Silence logs except for errors.

## EXAMPLES

Start a service named 'server':

```bash
flox services start server
```

Start all services:

```bash
flox services start
```

Attempt to start a service that doesn't exist:

```console
$ flox services start myservice doesnt_exist
✘ ERROR: Service 'doesnt_exist' not found.
```

Attempt to start a service that is already running:

```console
$ flox services start running not_running
✔ Service 'not_running' started
⚠️  Service 'running' is already running
```
