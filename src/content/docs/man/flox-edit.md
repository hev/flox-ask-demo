## NAME

flox-edit - edit the declarative environment configuration

## SYNOPSIS

```text
flox [<general options>] edit
     [-d=<path> | -r=<owner/name>]
     [[-f=<file>] | -n=<name> | --sync | --reset]
```

## DESCRIPTION

### Transactionally edit the environment manifest

By default, invokes an editor with a copy of the local manifest for the user to
interactively edit.
The editor is found by querying `$EDITOR`, `$VISUAL`,
and then by looking for common editors in `$PATH`.
The manifest of an environment on FloxHub or in a different directory
can be edited via the `-r` or `-d` flags respectively.
See [`manifest.toml(5)`](/docs/man/manifesttoml) for more details on the manifest
format.

Once the editor is closed the environment is built in order to validate the
edit.
If the build fails you are given a chance to continue editing the manifest,
and if you decline, the edit is discarded.
This transactional editing prevents an edit from leaving the environment in a
broken state.
One exception is the `-n` flag,
which renames a local environment but does not rebuild it.

The environment can be edited non-interactively via the `-f` flag,
which replaces the contents of the manifest with those of the provided file.

### Sync the local manifest with the current generation

When using environments that were pushed to or pulled from FloxHub,
changes to the local manifest in `.flox/env/manifest.toml`
will block the use of the environment commands
`flox {install, uninstall, edit, upgrade}`. To proceed, you can run either:

- `flox edit --sync` to commit your local changes to a new generation
- `flox edit --reset` to discard your local changes and reset to the latest generation

## OPTIONS

### Edit Options

**`-f`, `--file`**
Replace environment manifest with that in `<file>`.
If `<file>` is `-`, reads from stdin.

**`-n`, `--name`**
Rename the environment to `<name>`.
Only works for local environments.

**`-s`, `--sync`**
Create a new generation from the current local environment
(Only available for managed environments)

**`--reset`**
Reset the environment to the current generation
(Only available for managed environments)

### Environment Options

If no environment is specified for an environment command,
the environment in the current directory
or the active environment that was last activated is used.

**`-d`, `--dir`**
Path containing a .flox/ directory.

**`-r`, `--reference`**
A FloxHub environment, specified in the form `<owner>/<name>`.

**`-D`, `--default`**
Use your default environment (`<your-user>/default`).
When unauthenticated in an interactive context, you will be prompted to
log in.
In non-interactive contexts (e.g., scripts or CI), this flag will fail
with an error when authentication is missing.
### General Options

**`-h`, `--help`**
Prints help information.

The following options can be passed when running any `flox` subcommand but must
be specified _before_ the subcommand.

**`-v`, `--verbose`**
Increase logging verbosity.
Invoke multiple times for increasing detail.

**`-q`, `--quiet`**
Silence logs except for errors.

## ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

**`$EDITOR`, `$VISUAL`**
Override the default editor used for editing environment manifests and commit messages.
