## NAME

flox-uninstall - remove packages from an environment

## SYNOPSIS

```text
flox [<general options>] (uninstall|rm)
     [-d=<path> | -r=<owner/name>]
     <packages>
```

## DESCRIPTION

Uninstall packages from an environment.

Just like package installation, package uninstallation is transactional.
See [`flox-install(1)`](/docs/man/flox-install) for more details on transactions.
Requesting to uninstall multiple packages where at least one of them was not
previously installed will cause the transaction to fail
and no packages will be uninstalled.

## OPTIONS

### Remove Options

**`<packages>`**
The install IDs or package paths of the packages to remove.
If the manifest contains both an install ID and a package
with matching package path, the install ID takes precedence.
If the same package path is installed under different install IDs,
an error is returned.
A package path can optionally contain the original version constraint.

### Environment Options

If no environment is specified for an environment command,
the environment in the current directory
or the active environment that was last activated is used.

**`-d`, `--dir`**
Path containing a .flox/ directory.

**`-r`, `--reference`**
A FloxHub environment, specified in the form `<owner>/<name>`.

**`-D`, `--default`**
Use your default environment (`<your-user>/default`).
When unauthenticated in an interactive context, you will be prompted to
log in.
In non-interactive contexts (e.g., scripts or CI), this flag will fail
with an error when authentication is missing.
### General Options

**`-h`, `--help`**
Prints help information.

The following options can be passed when running any `flox` subcommand but must
be specified _before_ the subcommand.

**`-v`, `--verbose`**
Increase logging verbosity.
Invoke multiple times for increasing detail.

**`-q`, `--quiet`**
Silence logs except for errors.
