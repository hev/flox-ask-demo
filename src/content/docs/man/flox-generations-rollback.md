## NAME

flox-generations-rollback - switch to the previous live generation

## SYNOPSIS

```text
flox [<general-options>] generations rollback
     [-d=<path> | -r=<owner/name>]
```

## DESCRIPTION

Switch to the previous live generation of the environment.

Rolling back to the previous generation restores the environment's manifest and
lockfile to the state of the previous generation, sets it as the live
generation, and adds an entry to generation history.

The previously live generation isn't always N-1. If you've previously rolled
back from generation 3 -> 2 then rolling back again will take you from
generation 2 -> 3. Similarly if you've switched from generation 3 -> 1 then
rolling back will take you from generation 1 -> 3.

Generations don't always have a linear history. If you create generation 2 by
installing a package, rollback to generation 1 and create generation 3 by
installing another package, then generation 3 won't contain the package from
generation 2.

[`flox-generations-history(1)`](/docs/man/flox-generations-history) can be used to
see the relationships between generations.

## OPTIONS

### Environment Options

If no environment is specified for an environment command,
the environment in the current directory
or the active environment that was last activated is used.

**`-d`, `--dir`**
Path containing a .flox/ directory.

**`-r`, `--reference`**
A FloxHub environment, specified in the form `<owner>/<name>`.

**`-D`, `--default`**
Use your default environment (`<your-user>/default`).
When unauthenticated in an interactive context, you will be prompted to

In non-interactive contexts (e.g., scripts or CI), this flag will fail
with an error when authentication is missing.
### General Options

The following options can be passed when running any `flox` subcommand but must
be specified _before_ the subcommand.

**`-v`, `--verbose`**
Increase logging verbosity.
Invoke multiple times for increasing detail.

**`-q`, `--quiet`**
Silence logs except for errors.
