## NAME

flox-generations-switch - switch to the provided generation

## SYNOPSIS

```text
flox [<general-options>] generations switch
     [-d=<path> | -r=<owner/name>]
     <generation>
```

## DESCRIPTION

Switch to the provided generation of the environment.

Generation numbers can be found with
[`flox-generations-history(1)`](/docs/man/flox-generations-history) or
[`flox-generations-list(1)`](/docs/man/flox-generations-list).

Switching generation restores the environment's manifest and lockfile to the
state of the specified generation, sets it as the live generation, and adds
an entry to generation history.

Generations don't always have a linear history. If you create generation 2 by
installing a package, rollback to generation 1 and create generation 3 by
installing another package, then generation 3 won't contain the package from
generation 2.

[`flox-generations-history(1)`](/docs/man/flox-generations-history) can be used to
see the relationships between generations.

## OPTIONS

### Environment Options

If no environment is specified for an environment command,
the environment in the current directory
or the active environment that was last activated is used.

**`-d`, `--dir`**
Path containing a .flox/ directory.

**`-r`, `--reference`**
A FloxHub environment, specified in the form `<owner>/<name>`.

**`-D`, `--default`**
Use your default environment (`<your-user>/default`).
When unauthenticated in an interactive context, you will be prompted to

In non-interactive contexts (e.g., scripts or CI), this flag will fail
with an error when authentication is missing.
### General Options

**`-h`, `--help`**
Prints help information.

The following options can be passed when running any `flox` subcommand but must
be specified _before_ the subcommand.

**`-v`, `--verbose`**
Increase logging verbosity.
Invoke multiple times for increasing detail.

**`-q`, `--quiet`**
Silence logs except for errors.
