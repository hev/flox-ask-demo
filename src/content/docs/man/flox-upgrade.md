## NAME

flox-upgrade - upgrade packages in an environment

## SYNOPSIS

```text
flox [<general-options>] upgrade
     [-d=<path> | -r=<owner>/<name>]
     [--dry-run]
     [<package or pkg-group>]...
```

## DESCRIPTION

Upgrade packages in the environment.

When no arguments are specified,
all packages in the environment are upgraded if possible.
A package is upgraded if its version, build configuration,
or dependency graph changes.

Packages to upgrade can be specified by group name.
Packages without a specified pkg-group in the manifest
are placed in a group named 'toplevel'.
The packages in that group can be upgraded without updating any other groups
by passing 'toplevel' as the group name.

A single package can only be specified to upgrade by ID
if it is not in a group with any other packages.

See [`manifest.toml(5)`](/docs/man/manifesttoml) for more on using pkg-groups.

## OPTIONS

### Upgrade Options

**`--dry-run`**
Show available upgrades but do not apply them.

**`<package or pkg-group>`**
Install ID or pkg-group to upgrade.

### Environment Options

If no environment is specified for an environment command,
the environment in the current directory
or the active environment that was last activated is used.

**`-d`, `--dir`**
Path containing a .flox/ directory.

**`-r`, `--reference`**
A FloxHub environment, specified in the form `<owner>/<name>`.

**`-D`, `--default`**
Use your default environment (`<your-user>/default`).
When unauthenticated in an interactive context, you will be prompted to
log in.
In non-interactive contexts (e.g., scripts or CI), this flag will fail
with an error when authentication is missing.
### General Options

**`-h`, `--help`**
Prints help information.

The following options can be passed when running any `flox` subcommand but must
be specified _before_ the subcommand.

**`-v`, `--verbose`**
Increase logging verbosity.
Invoke multiple times for increasing detail.

**`-q`, `--quiet`**
Silence logs except for errors.
