## NAME

flox-generations-history - Show the change log for the current environment

## SYNOPSIS

```text
flox [<general-options>] generations history
     [-d=<path> | -r=<owner/name>]
     [-u]
     [--json]
     [--no-pager]
```

## DESCRIPTION

Show the change log for the current environment.

For environments pushed to FloxHub, every modification to the environment
creates a new generation of the environment.
It's also possible to change the current generation by using
`flox generations switch` or `flox generations rollback`.

`flox generations history` prints what generation has been the current
generation over time.

## OPTIONS

**`--json`**
Render generations as JSON. **Attention:** the output is not guaranteed to be stable.

**`--no-pager`**
Explicitly disable paged output

### Environment Options

If no environment is specified for an environment command,
the environment in the current directory
or the active environment that was last activated is used.

**`-d`, `--dir`**
Path containing a .flox/ directory.

**`-r`, `--reference`**
A FloxHub environment, specified in the form `<owner>/<name>`.

**`-D`, `--default`**
Use your default environment (`<your-user>/default`).
When unauthenticated in an interactive context, you will be prompted to
log in.
In non-interactive contexts (e.g., scripts or CI), this flag will fail
with an error when authentication is missing.
**`-u`, `--upstream`**
Operate on the environment on FloxHub, rather than a local reference.
### General Options

**`-h`, `--help`**
Prints help information.

The following options can be passed when running any `flox` subcommand but must
be specified _before_ the subcommand.

**`-v`, `--verbose`**
Increase logging verbosity.
Invoke multiple times for increasing detail.

**`-q`, `--quiet`**
Silence logs except for errors.
