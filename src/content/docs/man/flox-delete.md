## NAME

flox-delete - delete an environment

## SYNOPSIS

```text
flox [<general options>] delete
     [-f]
     [-d=<path>]
```

## DESCRIPTION

Deletes all data pertaining to an environment.
By default, only the environment in the current directory is deleted,
but environments in other directories may be deleted via the `-d` flag.

By default, you will be prompted for a confirmation before deleting the
environment.
The `-f` flag skips the confirmation dialog and is required for non-interactive
use.

## OPTIONS

### Delete Options

**`-f`, `--force`**
Delete the environment without confirmation.

### Environment Options

If no environment is specified for an environment command,
the environment in the current directory
or the active environment that was last activated is used.

**`-d`, `--dir`**
Path containing a .flox/ directory.

### General Options

**`-h`, `--help`**
Prints help information.

The following options can be passed when running any `flox` subcommand but must
be specified _before_ the subcommand.

**`-v`, `--verbose`**
Increase logging verbosity.
Invoke multiple times for increasing detail.

**`-q`, `--quiet`**
Silence logs except for errors.
