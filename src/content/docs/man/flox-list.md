## NAME

flox-list - list packages installed in an environment

## SYNOPSIS

```text
flox [<general-options>] list
     [-d=<path> | -r=<owner/name>]
     [-u]
     [-e | -c | -n | -a]
```

## DESCRIPTION

List packages installed in an environment.
The options `-n`, `-e`, and `-a` exist to provide varying levels of detail in
the output.

## OPTIONS

### List Options

**`-e`, `--extended`**
Show the install ID, pkg-path, and version of each package (default).

**`-c`, `--config`**
Show the raw contents of the manifest.
When using composition, the merged manifest will be shown without any
commented lines.

**`-n`, `--name`**
Show only the install ID of each package.

**`-a`, `--all`**
Show all available package information including priority, license,
and outputs (both available and installed).

### Environment Options

If no environment is specified for an environment command,
the environment in the current directory
or the active environment that was last activated is used.

**`-d`, `--dir`**
Path containing a .flox/ directory.

**`-r`, `--reference`**
A FloxHub environment, specified in the form `<owner>/<name>`.

**`-D`, `--default`**
Use your default environment (`<your-user>/default`).
When unauthenticated in an interactive context, you will be prompted to
log in.
In non-interactive contexts (e.g., scripts or CI), this flag will fail
with an error when authentication is missing.
**`-u`, `--upstream`**
Operate on the environment on FloxHub, rather than a local reference.
### General Options

**`-h`, `--help`**
Prints help information.

The following options can be passed when running any `flox` subcommand but must
be specified _before_ the subcommand.

**`-v`, `--verbose`**
Increase logging verbosity.
Invoke multiple times for increasing detail.

**`-q`, `--quiet`**
Silence logs except for errors.
