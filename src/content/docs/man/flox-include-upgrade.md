## NAME

flox-include-upgrade - upgrade an environment with latest changes to its
included environments

## SYNOPSIS

```text
flox [<general-options>] include upgrade
     [-d=<path> | -r=<owner/name>]
     [<included environment>]...
```

## DESCRIPTION

Get the latest contents of included environments and merge them with the
composing environment.

If the names of specific included environments are provided, only changes for
those environments will be fetched. If no names are provided, changes will be
fetched for all included environments.

## OPTIONS

**`<included environment>`**
Name of included environment to check for changes

### Environment Options

If no environment is specified for an environment command,
the environment in the current directory
or the active environment that was last activated is used.

**`-d`, `--dir`**
Path containing a .flox/ directory.

**`-r`, `--reference`**
A FloxHub environment, specified in the form `<owner>/<name>`.

**`-D`, `--default`**
Use your default environment (`<your-user>/default`).
When unauthenticated in an interactive context, you will be prompted to
log in.
In non-interactive contexts (e.g., scripts or CI), this flag will fail
with an error when authentication is missing.
### General Options

**`-h`, `--help`**
Prints help information.

The following options can be passed when running any `flox` subcommand but must
be specified _before_ the subcommand.

**`-v`, `--verbose`**
Increase logging verbosity.
Invoke multiple times for increasing detail.

**`-q`, `--quiet`**
Silence logs except for errors.
