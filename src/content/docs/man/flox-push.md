## NAME

flox-push - send environment to FloxHub

## SYNOPSIS

```text
flox [<general-options>] push
     [-d=<path>]
     [-o=<owner>]
     [-f]

flox [<general-options>] push
     -r=<owner>/<name>
     [-f]
```

## DESCRIPTION

Push an environment to FloxHub to share and centrally manage it with flox,
or sync changes made locally to a remote environment.

After pushing, the remote environment can be referred to as `<owner>/<name>`.

### Pushing from a directory using --dir -d

A path environment contains a manifest file and lock file which are stored
locally and possibly committed to version control.
Pushing the environment moves the manifest and lock file to FloxHub,
leaving a reference to the revision of the environment stored locally.

Once the environment has been pushed, it can be used directly with the
`--reference` option,
or it can be used and edited locally before syncing with `flox push`.
See [`flox-edit(1)`](/docs/man/flox-edit), [`flox-install(1)`](/docs/man/flox-install),
and [`flox-uninstall(1)`](/docs/man/flox-uninstall) for editing the environment.

### Pushing a remote environment using --reference -r

When using the `--reference` flag, commands will operate on a
**central persistent local copy** of the environment.
Any changes made to an environment using the `--reference` flag,
affect only the local copy and must be explicitly updated on FloxHub
using `flox push --reference`

### Conflict resolution

In the same way as a git repo, local changes to an environment that has been
pushed may diverge from the environment on FloxHub if `flox push` is run from a
different host.
Passing `--force` to `flox push` will cause it to overwrite any changes on
FloxHub with local changes to the environment.

## OPTIONS

### Push Options

**`-d`, `--dir`**
Push an environment in a directory to FloxHub.

Cannot be used with `--reference`.
Defaults to the current directory when `--reference` is not specified.

**`-o`, `--owner`, `--org`**
FloxHub owner to push environment to (default: current FloxHub user).

Can only be specified when pushing an environment for the first time.
Use 'flox pull --copy' to copy an existing environment and push it to a new
owner.

Cannot be used with `--reference`.

**`-r`, `--reference`**
Push local copy of a FloxHub environment upstream.

This pushes the local changes made to a FloxHub environment
using commands with the `--reference` flag.
Referring to environments, that have never been accessed
or explicitly pulled will cause an error.

Cannot be used with `--dir` or `--owner`.

**`-f`, `--force`**
Forcibly overwrite the remote copy of the environment.

### General Options

**`-h`, `--help`**
Prints help information.

The following options can be passed when running any `flox` subcommand but must
be specified _before_ the subcommand.

**`-v`, `--verbose`**
Increase logging verbosity.
Invoke multiple times for increasing detail.

**`-q`, `--quiet`**
Silence logs except for errors.
