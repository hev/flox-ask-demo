## NAME

flox-envs - show active and available environments

## SYNOPSIS

```text
flox [<general options>] envs
     [--active]
     [--json]
```

## DESCRIPTION

This command can be used to list available environments on the local machine.
When one or more environments are active,
the last activated environment will be listed first and printed in **bold**.

Whenever an environment is used with any `flox` command
it is registered to a user specific global registry.
`flox envs` will list all environments known to it through the registry.
Environments that are present on the local system may not show up
until they are used the first time.
Similarly, if an environment is changed
(e.g. deleted and replaced by an environment with different metadata),
the change may not show until the new environment is used.

## OPTIONS

### Envs Options

**`--active`**
Show only active environments

**`--json`**
Format the output as JSON

### General Options

**`-h`, `--help`**
Prints help information.

The following options can be passed when running any `flox` subcommand but must
be specified _before_ the subcommand.

**`-v`, `--verbose`**
Increase logging verbosity.
Invoke multiple times for increasing detail.

**`-q`, `--quiet`**
Silence logs except for errors.
